# Climate-Data-Predictor
## Project Overview

The Climate-Data-Predictor project is an end-to-end data science initiative aimed at predicting future weather conditions using historical data from various weather stations across the UK, provided by the MET Office.

## Key Features
### Data Extraction and Cleaning:
Automatically extracts, downloads, and cleans weather data from the MET Office for multiple UK weather stations. Cleans and preprocesses the extracted data, handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring consistency across the dataset.
### Feature Engineering: 
Performs feature engineering to create and enhance variables for improved model performance. Generates new features such as temperature range, average temperature, seasonal indicators, and more to enhance the predictive power of the models.
### LSTM Model for Prediction: 
Utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to model and predict future weather patterns. 
### Performance Evaluation: 
Trains individual LSTM models for different weather stations and evaluates their performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics.
### Model Evaluation:
Evaluates the trained models using MSE and RMSE to ensure accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
### Future Predictions:
Provides a 12-month weather forecast for each station, delivering actionable insights for future weather conditions.
### Results
The project offers accurate and reliable weather predictions for the next 12 months for various UK weather stations.
It delivers performance metrics (MSE and RMSE) for each model, ensuring transparency and reliability of the predictions.
This project is a comprehensive solution for weather prediction, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to deliver precise and actionable weather forecasts.
